-> To assess the security of the protocol, we use the Scyther tool in its latest Standard version (1.1.3) for the Microsoft Windows 10 Home Single Language operating system.

-> To run the BKE4ISP.spdl script and reproduce the results, you must first install the Scyther tool following the steps presented in: https://people.cispa.io/cas.cremers/scyther/install-generic.html. 

-> The settings used are the following: --auto-claims (which automatically generates the tests to be evaluated) and --max-runs=6 (which determines the number of rounds performed).

-> Then just import the BKE4ISP.spdl into the tool and run.
